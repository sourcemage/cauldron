@[install step]
It is time to install all of the spells to your system. There are two ways that
you can do this: manually, and using the @[smgl-enchant] script. Note
that system.tar.bz2 is @[required] for a new install.

manual method:
  @[tar -C $ENCHANT_TARGET -xjvf /system.tar.bz2]
  @[cd /var/cache/sorcery]
  @[tar -C $ENCHANT_TARGET -xvjf SPELL]

Remember to replace "SPELL" with the filename of the spell cache to install. As
an example, to install lilo:
@[ tar jxf /var/cache/sorcery/lilo-22.8-i486-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2 -C /mnt/root]

enchantment method (uses $ENCHANT_TMP/spells):
  @[enchantment install spells]

Enchant can also take a command-line argument to a cache file with a specified
path. This enables you to run enchant on any cache file you choose, from any
directory, without the tedium of typing in the tar line as given in the "manual
method" section. See @[ smgl-enchant] for more information.

When the step finishes type @[next].
