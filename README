This directory contains the *development* version of the following code
projects:

	cauldron (iso generation)
	enchantment (installer library and interfaces)
	ward (test framework)

If you would like to contribute to Cauldron development, please read HACKING
and API first. DESIGN will explain the general principles motivating how
Cauldron is set up and the general processes involved in building an ISO and
installing from one.

If you are looking for an area that you can contribute to, feel free to read
the ROADMAP, or ask around in #sourcemage or #sourcemage-cauldron on
irc.librera.chat.
